# Silly bubbles animation

This is a silly animation of a bunch of bubbles floating up. Made only in vanilla JS, some CSS and HTML.

## Requirements

Only a web browser is necessary.

## Inspiration

The main inspiration for this animation is the Bubbles.scr screensaver on Windows. I was originally trying to recreate the screensaver. However, I didn't recreate it with much accuracy, but I am satisfied enough with the result.

## Bugs

Open the animation in a new tab, then go to another tab. Then, after a few minutes, go back to the animation tab. A ton of bubbles will appear at once and the animation will lag. The longer you wait, the more laggy the animation becomes, and the more bubbles will appear.

## Other notes

This animation should be visible in my website: [try-an.github.io/bubbles](https://try-an.github.io/bubbles).
